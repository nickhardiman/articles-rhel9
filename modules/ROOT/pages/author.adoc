https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/container-platform[Openshift Container Platform] - that kind of thing. "Consultant" means I spend most of my time with customers, providing expert advice, building things and delivering projects. I'm also a https://rhtapps.redhat.com/verify?certId=160-229-787[Red Hat Certified Professional].
For automation, think https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible[Ansible Automation Platform] and  architect means I design as well as build.
