I'm Nick, an infrastructure consultant and automation architect at Red Hat.
"Infrastructure" means I work on platforms, automation and containers in the IT world. If you know Red Hat products, think 
https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux[RHEL OS],  
 
https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/container-platform[Openshift Container Platform] - that kind of thing. "Consultant" means I spend most of my time with customers, providing expert advice, building things and delivering projects. I'm also a https://rhtapps.redhat.com/verify?certId=160-229-787[Red Hat Certified Professional].
For automation, think https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible[Ansible Automation Platform] and  architect means I design as well as build. 

If you want to hear my English accent, check out my Red Hat Summit On-Demand Session https://events.experiences.redhat.com/widget/redhat/sum22/SessionCatalog22/session/1639849813644001fptx[Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux on a remote bare-metal server, using Ansible, Kickstart, and Redfish].

The _Here_ option above, up top in the navbar, can take you to my other documentation sections. There's a pop-up selector bottom left that does the same kind of thing. 

Here's my wishlist of things to document. 

*  Fedora on a Raspberry Pi 4 
*  RHEL on an ASUS PN50 
*  OCP4 on an ASUS PN51 
*  Satellite 6 on an HPE Proliant Gen10 Microserver
*  VMware Vsphere 7 on an Intel NUC
*  Ansible to tie it all together

[NOTE]
====
These docs have nothing to do with the official https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/[Product Documentation for Red Hat Enterprise Linux].

What can you do with a free Red Hat Developer subscription?  
A surprising amount, actually. 
As you can see from the navbar on the left, articles cover sysadmin tasks like these.  

* Install RHEL on a physical machine
* Create a network of virtual machines.
* Add containers to VMs. 
* Set up developer environments. 

These pages are for system administrators, not business administrators. 
The kind of people who enjoy hands on a keyboard, can cope with the CLI, and want to learn.
