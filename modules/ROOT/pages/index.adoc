Articles cover sysadmin tasks like these.  

* Install RHEL 9 on a physical machine
* Create a network of virtual machines.
* Add containers to VMs. 
* Set up developer environments. 

All these articles have examples to run, so you can learn by doing. Hands on a keyboard. Break it and fix it. 


== my test machine

I did all the work in my home lab using this combination of hardware and software.  
I did have to buy the hardware. 
The software is all included with a free https://developers.redhat.com/[Developer Subscription].
