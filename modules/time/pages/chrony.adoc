Make sure the clock is ticking.

Chronyd manages system time. It regularly asks NTP servers what the time is and sets the time for the OS to use. 

Chronyd sets system time using network servers, not the RTC (Real Time Clock). 
Many computers have a built-in quartz clock that permanently tracks time. PCs have one, Arduinos and Raspberry Pis don't, and VMs have an emulated RTC (check out /dev/rtc). The command `timedatectl` shows both system time and RTC time. 



== chronyd 

The chronyd daemon does the synchronization work, constantly checking network time and updating system time. 
Systemd unit chronyd.service manages the daemon. 

To see chronyd's log messages, run `journalctl -u chronyd`. 
It's pretty quiet. 
Chronyd can be configured to write all kinds of data to files in /var/log/chrony/, 
but by default this directory is empty. 
The Logging section in `man 5 chrony.conf` describes the options. 



== the NTP pool 

Chrony collects time from a few servers. 
The configuration file /etc/chrony.conf names one pool of servers to collect time from. 
The NTP servers are hidden behind this pool's DNS name - nne name points to many IP addresses.

[source,shell]
....
[nick@guest1 ~]$ grep pool  /etc/chrony.conf
# Use public servers from the pool.ntp.org project.
# Please consider joining the pool (http://www.pool.ntp.org/join.html).
pool 2.rhel.pool.ntp.org iburst
[nick@guest1 ~]$ 
....

The config line `pool 2.rhel.pool.ntp.org iburst` has three fields. 

* *pool* directive. Use one DNS name and check its IP addresses. For more information, run `man 5 chrony.conf`.
* *2.rhel.pool.ntp.org* DNS name. 
* *iburst* server option. When the sytem boots and chrony starts, get a good clock time by making many requests quickly (that's an initial burst of requests). 

This config is set up to use servers from the 
https://www.pool.ntp.org/en/use.html[pool.ntp.org] project.
There are 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTP_pool[thousands of servers] in this NTP pool, from all over the world. 
When a client resolves the name, their DNS checks what part of the world the client is in, picks four random servers, and replies with their addresses. 

To see how that DNS name resolves to IP addresses, use the _host_ command. 
This command isn't included with a minimal system, so install the _bind-utils_ package first. 

[source,shell]
....
[root@guest1 ~]# dnf install bind-utils
...
Complete!
[root@guest1 ~]# host 2.rhel.pool.ntp.org
2.rhel.pool.ntp.org has address 162.159.200.123
2.rhel.pool.ntp.org has address 82.219.4.30
2.rhel.pool.ntp.org has address 178.62.16.103
2.rhel.pool.ntp.org has address 185.53.93.157
2.rhel.pool.ntp.org has IPv6 address 2a01:7e00::f03c:91ff:fe96:f129
2.rhel.pool.ntp.org has IPv6 address 2a01:7e00::f03c:91ff:fe93:e774
2.rhel.pool.ntp.org has IPv6 address 2a03:b980:123:3::a
2.rhel.pool.ntp.org has IPv6 address 2a01:3e0:701:0:195:219:205:9
[root@guest1 ~]# 
....

To see which random IP addresses were picked for chronyd, use the _chronyc_ utility.

[source,shell]
....
[root@guest1 ~]# chronyc -n sources

== make chronyd step time 

Normally, chronyd fixes any time drift by changing system time in baby steps. 
When a computer boots up, chronyd takes one big step to fix system time - it finds out time from the network then overwrites the system time.  
This is important for VMs, with their shaky grasp of time. 

Test this by setting the time to yesterday, then rebooting. 
The time is reset. 

Check the config and current time. 

[source,shell]
....
[nick@guest1 ~]$ grep step /etc/chrony.conf 
# Allow the system clock to be stepped in the first three updates
makestep 1.0 3
[nick@guest1 ~]$ 
[nick@guest1 ~]$ timedatectl

To master chrony, read the man pages and experiment. 
There are many directives and options for the chrony.conf file, 
and many commands for the chronyc utility.
