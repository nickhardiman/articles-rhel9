= use RHSM to set system purpose

Use syspurpose to help subscription-manager automatically find the right subscription.

Using syspurpose is useful for organizations with more than one subscription. It helps subscription-manager automatically pick the right subscription.

* One of the spokes of Anaconda is system purpose, so it can be set manually during install. 
* Kickstart has a syspurpose configuration.  
* The CLI tool ``syspurpose`` can be used any time. 

Setting system purpose before subscribing a machine should make the ``--auto-attach`` option more accurate. 

Syspurpose can be used with a developer subscription, but it makes no difference. 
There is only one sub to choose. 
Also, the "Roles" and "Usage" fields are empty in a developer subscription. 
Filling in the equivalent syspurpose fields is fine, but they won't match.

For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/articles/system-purpose[Subscription-Manager for the former RHN user, part 13: System Purpose].


== set system purpose with syspurpose

Use the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/performing_an_advanced_rhel_installation/configuring-system-purpose-advanced_installing-rhel-as-an-experienced-user[syspurpose] 
command to describe what this machine is used for. 

Open a terminal. 
Use your admin user.
Prefix commands with sudo. 

[source,shell]
----
[nick@host1 ~]$ sudo syspurpose set role 'Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation'
role set to "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation".
[nick@host1 ~]$ 
[nick@host1 ~]$ sudo syspurpose set sla Self-Support
service_level_agreement set to "Self-Support".
[nick@host1 ~]$ 
[nick@host1 ~]$ sudo syspurpose set usage Development/Test
usage set to "Development/Test".
[nick@host1 ~]$ 
----

To remove these, run ``sudo syspurpose unset role``,  ``sudo syspurpose unset sla`` and ``sudo syspurpose unset usage``.

Check. The output is JSON.

[source,shell]
----
[nick@host1 ~]$ sudo syspurpose show
{
  "role": "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation",
  "service_level_agreement": "Self-Support",
  "usage": "Development/Test"
}
[nick@host1 ~]$ 
----


== use auto-attach 

Use RHSM (Red Hat Subscription Manager) to https://access.redhat.com/solutions/253273[register and subscribe] your new machine.

[source,shell]
----
subscription-manager register --username <username> --password <password> --auto-attach
----

The first time subscription-manager runs, it displays a warning about enabling a few plugins.

[source,shell]
----
[nick@host1 ~]$ sudo subscription-manager register --username nicktastic --password ';1!eB9-aW' --auto-attach
[sudo] password for nick: 
Registering to: subscription.rhsm.redhat.com:443/subscription
The system has been registered with ID: faa0b03b-2d45-41e7-a269-e71180cc5e5a
The registered system name is: rhel8.lab.example.com

WARNING

The yum/dnf plugins: /etc/dnf/plugins/subscription-manager.conf, /etc/dnf/plugins/product-id.conf were automatically enabled for the benefit of Red Hat Subscription Management. If not desired, use "subscription-manager config --rhsm.auto_enable_yum_plugins=0" to block this behavior.

[nick@host1 ~]$

Remove this registration with the command ``sudo subscription-manager unregister``.


== System Purpose Status: Mismatched  

Check subscription status. 

[source,shell]
----
[nick@host1 ~]$ sudo subscription-manager status 
+-------------------------------------------+
   System Status Details
+-------------------------------------------+
Overall Status: Current

System Purpose Status: Mismatched
- The requested usage preference "Development/Test" is not provided by a currently consumed subscription.
- The requested role "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation" is not provided by a currently consumed subscription.

[nick@host1 ~]$ 
----

Subscription-manager now complains that syspurpose values are "not provided by a currently consumed subscription". 

What's gone wrong? 
Nothing, these messages are harmless. 
But it does take some explaining. 

Subscription manager compares syspurpose fields with the consumed subscription fields. 

The syspurpose fields "role", "service_level_agreement" and "usage" are compared to these subscription-manager fields. 

[source,shell]
----
[root@host1 ~]# subscription-manager list --consumed
+-------------------------------------------+
   Consumed Subscriptions
+-------------------------------------------+
Subscription Name:   Red Hat Developer Subscription
...
Roles:               
Service Level:       Self-Support
Usage:               
...
----

The "Roles" and "Usage" fields are empty in a developer subscription, so the syspurpose values don't match.

Unsetting those two syspurpose values removes those _mismatched_ messages and resets ``System Purpose Status`` to ``Not Specified``.

[source,shell]
----
sudo syspurpose unset role
sudo syspurpose unset usage
sudo subscription-manager status
----

== set system purpose with subscription-manager

Subscription manager can set other values, like service level and usage.  
Setting these value helps with tasks like auto-attaching the right subscription from a list. 
Subscription-manager attempts to match fields in the available subscriptions. 

Subscription  manager tries to match fields in each subscription record. 

Open a terminal. 
Use the root account. 

[source,shell]
....
[root@host1 ~]# subscription-manager list --consumed
+-------------------------------------------+
   Consumed Subscriptions
+-------------------------------------------+
Subscription Name:   Employee SKU
...
Service Level:       Self-Support
Usage:               Development/Test
...
[root@host1 ~]# 
....

=== set service level 

Setting service level changes the line 'System Purpose Status: Not Specified' to 'System Purpose Status: Matched'.


No value is set. 

[source,shell]
....
[root@host1 ~]# subscription-manager service-level --show
Service level preference not set
[root@host1 ~]#
....

List choices.

[source,shell]
....
[root@host1 ~]# subscription-manager service-level --list
+-------------------------------------------+
           Available Service Levels
+-------------------------------------------+
Premium
Self-Support
Standard
[root@host1 ~]# 
....

Pick a value. 

This subscription is _Self-Support_.
If the wrong value is entered, remove the value with _subscription-manager service-level --unset_. 

[source,shell]
....
[root@host1 ~]# subscription-manager service-level --set=Self-Support
service_level_agreement set to "Self-Support".
[root@host1 ~]# 
....

Check. 

[source,shell]
....
[root@host1 ~]# subscription-manager status
+-------------------------------------------+
   System Status Details
+-------------------------------------------+
Overall Status: Current

System Purpose Status: Matched

[root@host1 ~]# 
....

=== set usage 

The usage field is similar. 

[source,shell]
....
[root@host1 ~]# subscription-manager usage --list
+-------------------------------------------+
               Available usage
+-------------------------------------------+
 - Development/Test
 - Production
[root@host1 ~]# 
....

[source,shell]
....
[root@host1 ~]# subscription-manager usage --set Development/Test
usage set to "Development/Test".
[root@host1 ~]# 
....

Setting this to something the machine is not entitled to shows a warning. 

[source,shell]
....
[root@host1 ~]# subscription-manager usage --set Production
usage set to "Production".
[root@host1 ~]# 
....

[source,shell]
....
[root@host1 ~]# subscription-manager status
+-------------------------------------------+
   System Status Details
+-------------------------------------------+
Overall Status: Current

System Purpose Status: Mismatched
- The requested usage preference "Production" is not provided by a currently consumed subscription.
