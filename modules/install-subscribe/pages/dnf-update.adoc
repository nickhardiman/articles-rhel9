Connect with SSH and update packages with DNF.

If a system is installed from an ISO, there are probably newer packages to install. 
Install media don't get updated with the latest packages. 
The older the ISO file, the more packages require updates. 

If a system is installed from Red Hat's CDN, there may not be newer packages.
