Register the workstation with https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/insights[Red Hat Insights]. Can be configured at install time?

Insights is distributed. There's the on-premise client, and the off-premise service that Red Hat runs in the cloud. 
The local client collects data and sends it to the remote Red Hat service, which analyzes it and delivers results.

Red Hat provides a management web interface at https://cloud.redhat.com/insights/.
When the insights client is run, it displays a URL to make it easy to find the machine's results on this Red Hat Cloud site. 
The local cockpit web console also provides a link to the cloud site. 

When you SSH to your fresh RHEL 8 install, you see this MOTD (Message Of The Day).
If you're on the Gnome desktop, you can only see these messages by looking at their files - ``cat /etc/motd.d/*``.

== insight-client components 

* engine: python code, _/usr/bin/insights-client_, _/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/insights_client/_, _/etc/insights-client/rpm.egg_
* log: current log and up to three older logs, _/var/log/insights-client/insights-client.log*_
* configuration: many files in _/etc/insights-client/_
* systemd: unit files, _/usr/lib/systemd/system/insights-*_


=== engine 

The insights client is written in Python, and can be https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-client[viewed on Github]. 
The core code is distributed in a https://packaging.python.org/glossary/#term-Egg[Python egg] at _/etc/insights-client/rpm.egg_.


=== log 

After registering with the Insights service, a new log file appears: /var/log/insights-client/insights-client.log.

Insights handles its own log rotation -  it doesn't use _logrotate_.
The insights client https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3035091[rotates the log after a successful upload], and keeps three copies.  
It doesn't check size. 

For developers, you can see the Python logging class  
https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#rotatingfilehandler[RotatingFileHandler]
and method 
https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler.doRollover[doRollover] 
in the code {link_with_underscores}[+__init__.py+].



=== configuration 

The /etc/insights-client/ directory contains many files, including some hidden ones. 
For a description, run _man insights-client.conf_. 

The insights-client creates a https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2462091[UUID].

[source,shell]
----
[nick@host1 ~]$ cat /etc/insights-client/machine-id
12345678-c063-43c7-a891-3f9a24c4dfb9[nick@host1 ~]$ 
[nick@host1 ~]$ 
----

=== systemd 

Insights uses a systemd timer. 
The service runs once a day. 
This is  configured in the unit file _/usr/lib/systemd/system/insights-client.timer_.

There's also a service that can be run (/usr/lib/systemd/system/insights-client.service).
It's disabled by default.
The unit's process type is _simple_ - it kicks off _/usr/bin/insights-client_ and exits.
