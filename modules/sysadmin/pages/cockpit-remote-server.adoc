Cockpit itself works by having a web interface that talks to the client using SSH as a transport mechanism
Instead of running a bash shell on the client, it runs cockpit-bridge.
This uses the cockpit PAM stack to authenticate and run commands, talk to dbus, etc. and sends the results back in a way the GUI can understand. 
So we need ssh ports open between the cockpit and clients.

== connect from cockpit to a remote machine

Add a hostname onto the end of the URL.
