If you just want some simple gratification, play around with these. 


=== prompt 

[source,shell]
---- 
[nick@host1 ~]$ 
----

A special set of symbols define how the prompt looks. 

[source,shell]
---- 
[nick@host1 ~]$ echo $PS1
[\u@\h \W]\$
[nick@host1 ~]$ 
----

To play around with the prompt layout, look at the man page (_man bash_) and search for _PROMPTING_. 
It has a big list of these backslash-escaped special characters.
