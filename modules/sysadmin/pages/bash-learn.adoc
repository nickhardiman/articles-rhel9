Bash knowledge is not shared out equally. 
Some knowledge is universal - you can't use Bash for five minutes without running _ls_. 
And some knowledge is arcane, like job control.
If you really want to find out what Bash is capable of, read the https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html[manual]. 


== learn Bash 

This is not a bash tutorial. There are plenty of free resources out there on the web and in bookstores. 

== learn the basics

* https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/bash/
* Pimoroni, the Raspberry Pi store, has learning resources. https://learn.pimoroni.com/getting-started-with-bash
* The GNU foundation provide a manual. https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html[manual]. 
* And so does The Linux Documentation Project. https://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/.

Cheat sheets summarize Bash commands. There are many on the web. 

* Julien Le Coupanec's page on GitHub: https://github.com/LeCoupa/awesome-cheatsheets/blob/master/languages/bash.sh
* https://github.com/rstacruz[Rico Sta. Cruz] made this pretty Devhints page: https://devhints.io/bash
* Many more have been posted to Cheatography: https://cheatography.com/tag/bash/

== read a book

* "Learning the bash Shell" is old and well-loved. https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-the-bash/0596009658/
* Books on Linux include plenty about Bash, like "Chapter 10. Working with files and folders on the command line" in "Learn Linux in a Month of Lunches".  https://www.manning.com/books/learn-linux-in-a-month-of-lunches
* Bookauthority lists many more books. https://bookauthority.org/books/best-bash-books

== RTFM (Read the Fucking Manual)

For variations on these initials, see [RTFM].

If you have already learned how to do something but can't quite remember the syntax, run `man bash`. This displays a long dense page, crammed with brief descriptions. 

The man page is no use to beginners. 
It's handy for advanced users who have forgotten part of the syntax, or are filling in holes in their knowledge, or who can't sleep.
