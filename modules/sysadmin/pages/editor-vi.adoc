Vi was written way back in the 1970s, and has been improved, copied and used by sysadmins ever since. 
Vi is a front end to the ex editor. 

One popular copy is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)[vim].  A minimal install may not include vim. 

Vi is not everyone's favourite, and there are many alternative editors. 
But vi is installed by default in the world of Red Hat.
You can rely on it being available, so it is worth climbing vi's learning curve, with its modes, single character commands and cryptic resource file.
