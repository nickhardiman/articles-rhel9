Typing long commands is annoying. 
That's why the GNU project added  https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Programmable-Completion.html[programmable completion].
The easiest completion is typing the first few characters of a command (three usually does it) and hitting the tab key (⇥). 

It's not good for all commands. 
If you want to type _hostnamectl_, then _hos⇥_ gets you _host_. 
Another tab displays three commands that all start with _host_.

[source,shell]
---- 
[nick@host1 ~]$ host⇥
hostid       hostname     hostnamectl  
[nick@host1 ~]$ host
----
