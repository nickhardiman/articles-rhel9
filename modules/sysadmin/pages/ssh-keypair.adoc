Generate a private key and public key. 

[source,shell]
....
[nick@host2 ~]$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/nick/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/nick/.ssh/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in /home/nick/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:aNCgs3UYfDOEOHuo4xb4tWa6sJaJ1VEyXwJZBbkeVo4 nick@host2.lab.example.com
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+

This less interactive version of the command does not ask for a passphrase or file location.

[source,shell]
....
keygen -t rsa -N '' -f /home/nick/.ssh/id_rsa
