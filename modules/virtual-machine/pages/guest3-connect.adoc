There is no way of connecting  from the home network. 
You can SSH from host1, or use the console.

== check the DHCP leases


We know the new VM is connected to two bridges, privbr0 and privbr1. Libvirt manages these bridges using  its two networks, private0 and private1.

The DHCP server hands out IP addresses from its pool. Libvirt can tell us which addresses are in use. 

Use SSH to connect from the workstation to _host1_. 

View DHCP leases in libvirt's private1 network.

[source,shell]
....
[nick@host2 ~]$ sudo virsh net-dhcp-leases private0 
 Expiry Time           MAC address         Protocol   IP address           Hostname   Client ID or DUID

View  leases in  private1.

=== try to connect using SSH

You can't use SSH (Secure SHell) to connect from _host1_ to your new RHEL machine.
The only account on this machine is root, but trying to connect with the password _Password;1_ does not work.
This is because of SSH daemon config. 
The root user is not allowed to connect remotely like this. 


[source,shell]
----
[nick@host2 ~]$ ssh root@192.168.152.114
root@192.168.152.114's password:   Password;1
Permission denied, please try again.
root@192.168.152.114's password: 
----


=== connect using the console

Connect to the console with the ``virsh console`` command.
Hit the Enter key kbd:[⏎]  to get the _guest2 login_ prompt to appear. 

[source,shell]
----
[nick@host2 ~]$ sudo virsh console guest2
[sudo] password for nick: 
Connected to domain 'guest2'
Escape character is ^] (Ctrl + ])

guest2 login: 
----

Trying to login over SSH with the password _Password;1_ failed.
Logging in on the console with the same password succeeds. 

[source,shell]
----
guest2 login: root
Password:  Password;1
Last failed login: Mon Aug  1 12:38:34 BST 2022 from 192.168.152.1 on ssh:notty
There was 1 failed login attempt since the last successful login.
Last login: Sun Jul 31 21:26:19 on ttyS0
[root@guest2 ~]# 
----

That's enough to prove the virtual machine is working OK. 

Disconnect from the console. 
The disconnection command is 
kbd:[Ctrl + ++]++ ] 


[source,shell]

[root@host1 ~]#
