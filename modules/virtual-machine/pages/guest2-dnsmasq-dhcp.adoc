Set up a name and address for the new VM _guest2_. Use dnsmasq to fix the IP address _192.168.152.100_ and the 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name[FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)] _guest2.private.example.com_.

RHEL 8 includes a complete system for managing VMs (virtual machines) - the KVM hypervisor, QEMU machine emulator and libvirt tools. 
The libvirt daemon uses http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html[dnsmasq] to provide 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol[DHCP] 
and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System[DNS] services. 
This article configures dnsmasq to set a fixed IPv4 address and domain name for our new guest VM. 

The _privbr0_ DHCP setup isn't great if you want to SSH to your new VM, because it takes some work to figure out what IPv4 address to use.  
When the guest VM boots up, it is given the address 192.168.152...er...something. 
The dnsmasq DHCP service assigns addresses from an IP pool, so the VM gets a random address from the range 192.168.152.0/24. 

Instead of searching for the address after every boot, it's easier to assign a fixed IP address. 
All we need to get started is the MAC address, and that was fixed by the _virt-install_ command when the VM was created (``52:54:00:00:00:03``). 

People remember names better than numbers. A fixed IP address is easier to use than a random IP address, and a DNS name is easier still.  
Out of the box, dnsmasq reads names and addresses from the /etc/hosts file. 
Add _guest2.private.example.com_ to two places. 

* the host's /etc/hosts file, so the host can look up the guest's name
* the host's dnsmasq configuration, so guests can look up the name


== dnsmasq services 

Usually _systemd_ is in charge of running services, but not here. 
The _libvirtd_ daemon controls _dnsmasq_ services, not systemd. 
Running the command ``systemctl status dnsmasq`` says dnsmasq isn't running. 

[source,shell]
....
[nick@host1 ~]# systemctl status dnsmasq
‚óè dnsmasq.service - DNS caching server.
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/dnsmasq.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: inactive (dead)
[nick@host1 ~]# 
....

One pair of processes - a parent and child - are started for each libvirt network that needs DHCP.
The _pubbr0_ network doesn't use dnsmasq.
The _default_ and _privbr0_ networks do.

[source,shell]
....
[nick@host1 ~]# ps -fwwC dnsmasq
UID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
dnsmasq     2077       1  0 08:16 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/dnsmasq --conf-file=/var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/default.conf --leasefile-ro --dhcp-script=/usr/libexec/libvirt_leaseshelper
root        2078    2077  0 08:16 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/dnsmasq --conf-file=/var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/default.conf --leasefile-ro --dhcp-script=/usr/libexec/libvirt_leaseshelper
dnsmasq    16756       1  0 20:16 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/dnsmasq --conf-file=/var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/privbr0.conf --leasefile-ro --dhcp-script=/usr/libexec/libvirt_leaseshelper
root       16757   16756  0 20:16 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/dnsmasq --conf-file=/var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/privbr0.conf --leasefile-ro --dhcp-script=/usr/libexec/libvirt_leaseshelper
[nick@host1 ~]#  
....



== check the IP pool 

View the dnsmasq configuration. 
Its config files are in the folder /var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/. 

This ``dhcp-range`` line tells dnsmasq what IP pool to manage for the _privbr0_ network. 

[source,shell]
....
[nick@host1 ~]$ sudo grep dhcp-range /var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/privbr0.conf
[sudo] password for nick: 
dhcp-range=192.168.152.2,192.168.152.254,255.255.255.0
dhcp-range=2001:db8:ca2:3::1,ra-only
[nick@host1 ~]$ 
....

View the libvirt configuration. 
libvirt writes that dnsmasq configuration after reading its own network configuration.
You can see libvirt's configuration  using the ``virsh net-dumpxml`` command.
There are about 20 lines of XML that define the network.
These are all listed further down. 

The IP pool config is between a pair of dhcp tags.  

[source,shell]
....
[nick@host1 ~]$ sudo virsh net-dumpxml privbr0
...
    <dhcp>
      <range start='192.168.152.2' end='192.168.152.254'/>
    </dhcp>
...
[nick@host1 ~]$ 
....


== assign a name and address

Add an XML tag to the network's configuration.

This dnsmasq config file can't be edited directly because it's created by libvirt - any changes would be overwritten. 
Instead, use ``virsh`` commands to add config. 


=== add the private.example.com domain 

Add the domain _private.example.com_ before adding the name _guest2.private.example.com_.

dnsmasq has a security feature that ignores DNS domains it doesn't recognize. 
The privbr0 configuration has no domain, so adding a full FQDN for the VM (_guest2.private.example.com_) won't work. 
Journalctl would show an error like this. 

[source,shell]
....
May 29 18:17:15 host.private.example.com dnsmasq-dhcp[2380]: Ignoring domain private.example.com for DHCP host name guest2
....


Adding a domain is a little painful, both because editing XML is never fun, and because the network must be stopped and started after this edit to pick up the configuration change. 


[source,shell]
....
[nick@host1 ~]$ sudo virsh net-edit privbr0
....

virsh fires up the vi editor and displays this. 

[source,xml]
....
<network>
  <name>privbr0</name>
  <uuid>88c35d22-05d7-4e1f-ae02-d1906f7a0bbc</uuid>
  <bridge name='privbr0' stp='on' delay='0'/>
  <mac address='52:54:00:23:0f:f9'/>
  <domain name='private.example.com' localOnly='yes'/>
  <ip address='192.168.152.1' netmask='255.255.255.0'>
    <dhcp>
      <range start='192.168.152.2' end='192.168.152.254'/>
    </dhcp>
  </ip>
  <ip family='ipv6' address='2001:db8:ca2:3::1' prefix='64'>
  </ip>
</network>
....

Add a domain by adding this line between the network tags:   
 ``<domain name='private.example.com' localOnly='yes'/>``.

The file now looks like this. 

[source,xml]
....
<network>
  <name>privbr0</name>
  <uuid>88c35d22-05d7-4e1f-ae02-d1906f7a0bbc</uuid>
  <bridge name='privbr0' stp='on' delay='0'/>
  <mac address='52:54:00:23:0f:f9'/>
  <domain name='private.example.com' localOnly='yes'/>
  <ip address='192.168.152.1' netmask='255.255.255.0'>
    <dhcp>
      <range start='192.168.152.2' end='192.168.152.254'/>
    </dhcp>
  </ip>
  <ip family='ipv6' address='2001:db8:ca2:3::1' prefix='64'>
  </ip>
</network>
....

Save and exit. 

Restart the network. 
Check its state before and after - it changes from _inactive_ to _active_. 

[source,shell]
....
Network privbr0 XML configuration edited.

[nick@host1 ~]$ sudo virsh net-destroy privbr0
Network privbr0 destroyed

[nick@host1 ~]$ sudo virsh net-list --all
 Name                 State      Autostart     Persistent
----------------------------------------------------------
 privbr0              inactive   yes           yes

[nick@host1 ~]$ 
[nick@host1 ~]$ sudo virsh net-start privbr0
Network privbr0 started

[nick@host1 ~]$ 
[nick@host1 ~]$ sudo virsh net-list --all
 Name      State      Autostart   Persistent
----------------------------------------------
 default   active     yes         yes
 privbr0   active     yes         yes
 pubbr0    active     yes         yes

[nick@host1 ~]$ 
....

Virsh updates the dnsmasq config.

[source,shell]
....
[nick@host1 ~]$ sudo grep private.example.com /var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/privbr0.conf
local=/private.example.com/
domain=private.example.com
[nick@host1 ~]$ 
....



=== add the FQDN and IPv4 address to libvirt's config

It's easier to add the host name and address. 
Use _virsh net-update_, which doesn't require a network restart. 
The command contains the line of XML to be added. 
The name in the _name_ attribute matches the hostname set by the ``virt-customize`` command.
The ``--live`` and ``--config`` options make sure both the current configuration and the stored config are updated.

[source,shell]
....
sudo virsh net-update privbr0 add ip-dhcp-host \
    "<host  mac='52:54:00:00:00:01' name='guest2.private.example.com' ip='192.168.152.100' />" \
    --live \
    --config
....

Add the host line. 

[source,shell]
....
[nick@host1 ~]$ sudo virsh net-update privbr0 add ip-dhcp-host "<host mac='52:54:00:00:00:01' name='guest2.private.example.com' ip='192.168.152.100' />" --live --config
Updated network privbr0 persistent config and live state
[nick@host1 ~]$ 
....

You can remove this line by replacing ``add`` with ``delete``. 

Check your work with the command `sudo virsh net-dumpxml privbr0`. 
The config XML now looks like this. 

[source,xml]
....
<network>
  <name>privbr0</name>
  <uuid>88c35d22-05d7-4e1f-ae02-d1906f7a0bbc</uuid>
  <bridge name='privbr0' stp='on' delay='0'/>
  <mac address='52:54:00:23:0f:f9'/>
  <domain name='private.example.com' localOnly='yes'/>
  <ip address='192.168.152.1' netmask='255.255.255.0'>
    <dhcp>
      <range start='192.168.152.2' end='192.168.152.254'/>
      <host mac='52:54:00:00:00:03' name='guest2.private.example.com' ip='192.168.152.100'/>
    </dhcp>
  </ip>
  <ip family='ipv6' address='2001:db8:ca2:3::1' prefix='64'>
  </ip>
</network>
....


=== add the FQDN and IPv4 address to the host 

Machine _host1_ doesn't use dnsmasq. 
The host machine has no idea what the name and address of this new VM are. 

Add a line to /etc/hosts. 

[source,shell]
....
[nick@host1 ~]$ sudo bash -c 'echo "192.168.152.100 guest2 guest2.private.example.com" >> /etc/hosts'
[nick@host1 ~]$ 
....


== check your work 

=== watch the activity log

When the _guest2_ VM starts, it uses DHCP to obtain an IP address.
The guest VM starts by broadcasting a 'looking for DHCP server' message and gets an answer from dnsmasq on the host machine. 
You can see the conversation taking place using ``journalctl``.

[source,shell]
....
[nick@host1 ~]$ journalctl -f
...

....


=== stop and start the VM 

Check whether guest2 is running with ``virsh dominfo guest2``.
Stop the guest VM with ``virsh shutdown guest2``. 
Start with ``virsh start guest2``.



=== resolve the name 

dnsmasq only listens to the libvirt network interface. 

[source,shell]
....
[nick@host1 libvirt]# host guest2.private.example.com 192.168.152.1
Using domain server:
Name: 192.168.152.1
Address: 192.168.152.1#53
Aliases:

[nick@host1 libvirt]# 
....

Can the host find it?
Try with the short name. 

[source,shell]
....
[nick@host1 ~]$ ping -c1 guest2
