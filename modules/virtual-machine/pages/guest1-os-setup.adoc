Carry out some first-run sysadmin on the new machine. 

Many things are already configured, like SSH daemon, NTP, hostname and first interface. 

== IP address and DNS 

The first network interface on _guest1_ is connected to the home network. 
It has probably been given an IP address by the DHCP server built into the ISP router. 

Virsh can't tell you because it isn't managing DHCP for this interface. The _virsh net-dhcp-leases pubbr0_ won't work. 

Find the address. 

* Connect to the console, log into the machine, run _ip addr_ and copy the IP address.
This is the easiest way. 
* Find out what IP address the home DHCP server allocated.  
This depends on what your home network equipment is. 
* Watch network traffic. Run _sudo tcpdump -nn ether host 52:54:00:00:00:01_ on _host1_ and wait for something to happen. 
This is proper network admin. 

== connect using SSH 

Copy your public key for easier and safer login. 

[source,shell]
....
ssh-copy-id nick@guest1
....

SSH from your workstation to the machine. 

== harden security  

Anyone on the home network can get at this machine, so security is an issue. 

Disable root login. 

* Use the root account. 
* Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config.
* Change PermitRootLogin to no.
* Restart the service with _systemctl reload sshd.service_


== update packages 

The kickstart process registered this machine with Red Hat and entitled it to receive updates. 

[source,shell]
....
[root@guest1 ~]# dnf -y update
...
[root@guest1 ~]# systemctl reboot
Connection to guest1 closed by remote host.
Connection to guest1 closed.
workstation:~ nick$ 
....

Wait a minute and log in again.
