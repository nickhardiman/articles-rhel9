We can connect to the new machine using the console. 

== connect using the console

Connect to the console with the ``virsh console`` command.
Hit the Enter key kbd:[‚èé]  to get the _guest2 login_ prompt to appear. 

[source,shell]
----
[nick@host2 ~]$ sudo virsh console guest2
[sudo] password for nick: 
Connected to domain 'guest2'
Escape character is ^] (Ctrl + ])

guest2 login: 
----

Trying to login over SSH with the password _Password;1_ failed.
Logging in on the console with the same password succeeds. 

[source,shell]
----
guest2 login: root
Password:  Password;1
Last failed login: Mon Aug  1 12:38:34 BST 2022 from 192.168.152.1 on ssh:notty
There was 1 failed login attempt since the last successful login.
Last login: Sun Jul 31 21:26:19 on ttyS0
[root@guest2 ~]#

That's enough to prove the virtual machine is working OK. 

Disconnect from the console. 
The disconnection command is 
kbd:[Ctrl + ++]++ ]

== connect using SSH

We could use an IP address to connect to the new machine, if we knew it. 
How do you find the IP address of the new guest?

The arp command shows entries like this, which contain MAC address but no IP address.  

[source,shell]
....
[nick@host2 ~]$ arp
Address                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask            Iface
guest1                   ether   52:54:00:00:00:02   C                     pubbr0
...
host1                    ether   24:4b:fe:c8:40:a9   C                     pubbr0

== find the IP address of enp2s0 from host1

We know the new VM is connected to two bridges, pubbr0 and privbr0. 
Libvirt manages these bridges using its two networks, public0 and private0.

The home network router assigned an address for guest1 to use on the home network.
The OS has probably already associated this with enp1s0. 
There's no easy way of seeing what this is. 

The DHCP server hands out IP addresses from its pool for privbr0. 
Libvirt can tell us which addresses are in use. 

Use SSH to connect from the workstation to _host1_. 

View DHCP leases in libvirt's private0 network.

[source,shell]
....
[nick@host2 ~]$ sudo virsh net-dhcp-leases private0 
 Expiry Time           MAC address         Protocol   IP address           Hostname   Client ID or DUID

== find the IP address of enp1s0 from host1

The first network interface on _guest1_ is connected to the home network. 
It has probably been given an IP address by the DHCP server built into the ISP router. 

Virsh can't tell you because it isn't managing DHCP for this interface. The _virsh net-dhcp-leases pubbr0_ won't work. 

A few ways to find the address: 

* Find out what IP address the home DHCP server allocated.  
This depends on what your home network equipment is. 
* Watch network traffic. Run _sudo tcpdump -nn ether host 52:54:00:00:00:02_ on _host1_ and wait for something to happen. 

This is proper network admin. 


== find the IP address of enp1s0 using the console

* Connect to the console, 
* log into the machine, 
* run _ip addr_ and 
* copy the IP address.



== connect using SSH 

[source,shell]
....
ssh nick@192.168.152.71
....


== connect using SSH and key-based login  

Copy your public key for easier and safer login. 

[source,shell]
....
ssh-copy-id nick@192.168.152.71
....

SSH from your workstation to the machine.
