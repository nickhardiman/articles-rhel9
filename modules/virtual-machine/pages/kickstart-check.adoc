Check the kickstart file. 
The kickstart validation utility _ksvalidator_ provides a static analysis of the new file.
It's like a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)[software linter] for kickstart configuration. 

_ksvalidator_ is not installed by default. 
The validator helps to catch mistakes like typos, like this. 

[source,shell]
....
[root@host1 libvirt]# ksvalidator guest1.ks 
The following problem occurred on line 3 of the kickstart file:

Unknown command: ingoredisk

[root@host1 libvirt]# 
....

Install the kickstart tools package. 
The package also contains tools _ksflatten_, _ksshell_ and _ksverdiff_.

[source,shell]
....
[root@host1 libvirt]# dnf install pykickstart 
...
Complete!
[root@host1 libvirt]# 
....

Validate the file. 
No news is good news. 

[source,shell]
....
[root@host1 libvirt]# ksvalidator guest1.ks 
[root@host1 libvirt]# 
....
