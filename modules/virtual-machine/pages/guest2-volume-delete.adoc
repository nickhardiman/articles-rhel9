Delete the new volume.

If you want to remove this new file and start again, delete it with _virsh vol-delete_. 
Don't use the bash command _rm_ because it removes the file and leaves behind libvirt's configuration about this file. 
The _vol-delete_ command removes both the file and libvirt's config. 

[source,shell]

[root@host1 images]# virsh vol-delete $MY_COPY --pool images
