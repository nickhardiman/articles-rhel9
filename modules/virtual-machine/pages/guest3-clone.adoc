= use guest2's image to create guest3

Create another VM like guest2. 
Instead of installing from scratch, the way _guest1_ and _guest2_ were created, base it on guest2.
Start by creating a new image file that holds the storage volume.

Feel free to say _disk_, _storage volume_ or _image file_. 

* _guest3_ thinks it is a disk. 
* _host1_ thinks it is an image file. 
* _Libvirt_ thinks it is a file containing a storage volume. 

The _guest2.qcow2_ storage volume has all the files guest3 needs.
Make a copy of guest2's storage and customize it a little.
This takes less time and effort than installing the OS from scratch.

Shutdown guest2. 

If guest2 is still running, virt-clone refuses to work, saying _Domain with devices to clone must be paused or shutoff_.

[source,shell]
----
[root@host1 ~]# virsh shutdown guest2
Domain guest2 is being shutdown

[root@host1 ~]# 
[root@host1 ~]# virsh list --all
 Id   Name     State
-------------------------
 1    guest1   running
 -    guest2   shut off

[root@host1 ~]# 
----


Copy the guest2 VM.

[source,shell]
----
[root@host1 ~]# virt-clone --original guest2 --name guest3 --file /var/lib/libvirt/images/guest3.qcow2
Allocating 'guest3.qcow2'                                          |  30 GB  00:00:03     
Allocating 'guest3_VARS.fd'                                        | 528 kB  00:00:00     

Clone 'guest3' created successfully.
[root@host1 ~]#

The new _guest3.qcow2_ file does need to be changed. 
It has the wrong hostname. 

== view the hostname with virt-inspector

The _virt-inspector_ utility can display the hostname. 
In fact, it produces a vast amount of data about all kinds of operating system things. 
The output is an XML document - it's thousands of lines long, and mostly describes installed packages. 

The _virt-customize_ utility is included in the _libguestfs-tools_ package.

Install the _libguestfs-tools_ package. 

[source,shell]
----
sudo dnf install libguestfs-tools
----

Use XPATH to display the hostname part of the XML document. 

[source,shell]
----
[root@host1 ~]# virt-inspector -a /var/lib/libvirt/images/guest3.qcow2 | virt-inspector --xpath '//hostname'
<hostname>guest2.private.example.com</hostname>
[root@host1 ~]# 
----



== reset the VM with virt-sysprep

The new VM contains unwanted data.
It has guest2's host keys, network settings. log entries and so on. 
The virt-sysprep command can clean up the new machine by removing these. 

[source,shell]
----
[root@host1 ~]# virt-sysprep --domain guest3
[   0.0] Examining the guest ...
[   2.0] Performing "abrt-data" ...
[   2.0] Performing "backup-files" ...

...(about 40 actions)...

[   2.7] Setting a random seed
[   2.7] Setting the machine ID in /etc/machine-id
[   2.8] Performing "lvm-uuids" ...
[root@host1 ~]# 
----


== change the hostname with virt-customize 

Change the hostname. 

[source,shell]
----
virt-customize \
  --add       /var/lib/libvirt/images/guest3.qcow2  \
  --hostname  guest3.private.example.com \
  --selinux-relabel
----

Run the command. 

[source,shell]
----
[root@host1 ~]# virt-customize \
>   --add       /var/lib/libvirt/images/guest3.qcow2  \
>   --hostname  guest3.private.example.com \
>   --selinux-relabel

[root@host1 ~]#

== view libvirt's list of volumes 

Libvirt keeps a list of volumes in its storage pools. 
It should already know about the new file guest3.qcow2. 

List all the volumes in the _images_ storage pool with the `virsh vol-list images` command.

[source,shell]
----
[root@host1 ~]# virsh vol-list images
 Name                               Path
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 guest1.qcow2                       /var/lib/libvirt/images/guest1.qcow2
 guest2.qcow2                       /var/lib/libvirt/images/guest2.qcow2
 rhel-8.3-x86_64-dvd.iso            /var/lib/libvirt/images/rhel-8.3-x86_64-dvd.iso
 rhel-8.3-x86_64-kvm.qcow2          /var/lib/libvirt/images/rhel-8.3-x86_64-kvm.qcow2

[root@host1 ~]# 
----

The new file isn't there.

Tell libvirt to update its list with `virsh pool-refresh images`.

[source,shell]
----
[root@host1 libvirt]# virsh pool-refresh images
Pool images refreshed

[root@host1 libvirt]# virsh vol-list images
 Name                               Path
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 guest1.qcow2                       /var/lib/libvirt/images/guest1.qcow2
 guest2.qcow2                       /var/lib/libvirt/images/guest2.qcow2
 guest3.qcow2                       /var/lib/libvirt/images/guest3.qcow2
 rhel-8.3-x86_64-dvd.iso            /var/lib/libvirt/images/rhel-8.3-x86_64-dvd.iso
 rhel-8.3-x86_64-kvm.qcow2          /var/lib/libvirt/images/rhel-8.3-x86_64-kvm.qcow2
----


Get more details with the _virsh vol-info_ command. 

[source,shell]
----
[root@host1 libvirt]# virsh vol-info guest3.qcow2 images
Name:           guest3.qcow2
Type:           file
Capacity:       30.00 GiB
Allocation:     2.53 GiB

[root@host1 libvirt]# 
----


== delete the new VM

If something goes wrong, remove the new machine and image file with this command. 

[source,shell]
----
virsh undefine --nvram --remove-all-storage guest3
----


== start both machines 

[source,shell]
----
virsh start guest2
virsh start guest3
----
