When the guest1 VM boots up, the second network interface is given the IP address 192.168.152...er...something. 
The dnsmasq DHCP service assigns addresses from an IP pool, so the VM gets a random address from the range 192.168.152.0/24. 

Libvirt reads host details from a line like this in its XML config. 

[source,XML]
....
<host mac='52:54:00:00:00:02' name='guest1.private.example.com' ip='192.168.152.100' />
....



== DHCP lease 

The DHCP lease is stored in a status file. 

[source,shell]
....
[root@host1 ~]# cat /var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/privbr0.status
[
  {
    "ip-address": "192.168.152.28",
    "mac-address": "52:54:00:00:00:02",
    "hostname": "guest1",
    "client-id": "01:52:54:00:00:00:02",
    "expiry-time": 1610486851
  }
]
[root@host1 ~]# 
....
