Read the image, create a container and get it to do something. 

An ubi8 container doesn't run anything interesting on its own.
It will start, do nothing, then immediately stop.
Give it something to do by adding a command on the end of the _run_ command. 

== run a container 

These commands create a container and run one command. 
When the command exits, so does the container.
