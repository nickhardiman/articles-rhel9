The buildah and podman projects are separate, but complementary. The buildah and podman tools can do some of the same tasks, like creating an image, pulling from a registry and listing images. 

== list images 

The two commands `buildah images` and `podman images` do the same thing. 

[source,shell]
----
[root@guest1 ~]# buildah images
REPOSITORY         TAG      IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
localhost/myperl   latest   3b64d9df0def   27 minutes ago   557 MB
[root@guest1 ~]# 
[root@guest1 ~]# podman images
REPOSITORY        TAG     IMAGE ID      CREATED         SIZE

[root@guest1 ~]#

The commands `buildah containers` and `buildah ps` both list running containers, but they list different sets of running containers. 
The command _buildah ps_ lists buildah's working containers, and _podman ps_ lists podman containers.
