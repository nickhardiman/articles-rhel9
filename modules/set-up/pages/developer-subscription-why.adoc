Red Hat 
https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-leading-enterprise-linux-server-market[leads the enterprise server market].
Red Hat is a source of enterprise software and sells support subscriptions. 
It also has a free tier. 
You can use some Red Hat software and services for free with a Developer Subscription. 

The Developer Subscription is a self-service account for individuals.
It's aimed at development work, not production work. 

If you don’t have a paid Red Hat subscription, you can use some Red Hat services for free by signing up for a Developer Subscription. 
It's free. 
Surely every student of GNU/Linux and enterprise applications should have one. 

== a Red Hat Developer Subscription

This subscription gives you access to the RHEL OS, a truck-load of other Red Hat software, and some of their services. 

Red Hat is not in the hardware business. Unless you count swag. 
RHEL 8 runs on many different types of computer, but it's down to you to provide a home lab for your experiments. 

If you don’t have a paid Red Hat subscription, you can use some Red Hat services for free with a Developer Subscription. 

On the software side, the developer subscription provides access to RHEL, developer tools and a mix of applications.  
The developer subscription does not provide access to the complete tech stack of Red Hat's software, which is basically a huge library of operating systems and applications. 


== why install RHEL 8

A serious home lab deserves a serious software stack. 

You want to ...

* check out what's changed between RHEL 7 and RHEL 8. 
* uninstall and reinstall services without annoying your colleagues. 
* put in some R&D time with virtual machines and containers.
* practice your sysadmin skills with the world's leading enterprise platform. 
* litter your workspace with developer tools.


== why not use Fedora instead

https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/fedora-vs-red-hat-enterprise-linux

The focus of RHEL 8 is to be stable in production. 
Enterprise-grade scalability.
A lot of updates are produced. Bugs are fixed, vulnerabilities are removed, and features are enhanced. 
Major versions stay put. Minor version upgrades are checked to make sure they don't break anything. 
A lot of security work is done, like compiling more securely and certifying against security standards. 




== free RHEL 8 stuff    

For more information, see the https://developers.redhat.com/articles/faqs-no-cost-red-hat-enterprise-linux/[FAQs for no-cost Red Hat Enterprise Linux
machine entitlements]. 

=== machine registration

* one physical machine
* unlimited VMs (Virtual Machines) on your physical machine.
* development machine only. Don't use this in production. 
* valid for 12 months. You can renew.

=== software  

* The full enterprise-grade RHEL OS. That includes the current version 8 and previous versions. 
* errata from the Red Hat CDN (Content Delivery Network). The Red Hat CDN is a global proxy network that handles security, performance and scalability. Customer systems regularly download errata (bug fixes, security patches and enhancements) from the CDN.
* developer software

=== support 

The subscription is officially _Self-Support_. But there is some limited support from Red Hat. You can create a support case if you have trouble with registration or yum updates. 


=== new RHEL Beta releases

A developer is also entitled to download each new RHEL Beta release, 
although it's not included in the Developer Subscription.
A Beta release is good for early exposure, but there are no seatbelts. 
A Beta release is not supported in any way, and there's no way to upgrade to to the GA (General Availability) release when it appears. 


== more free stuff     

Your new developer account includes a developer subscription. 
This gets you up and running with RHEL 8, with a year of Red Hat support.
It also gets you access to sites, products and knowledge.

Access to the Subscriber-only content on the Red Hat Customer Portal, access.redhat.com.


=== applications  

* customer portal, https://access.redhat.com/. This is the gateway for support - instruction videos, community discussions, software downloads, and so on.

You can use https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/03/11/eclipse-che-overview/[Eclipse Che] to fire up a working example on Openshift. For example, if you want to develop a NodeJS Angular application, one click pulls a container from https://quay.io/repository/eclipse/, code from  
https://github.com/gothinkster/angular-realworld-example-app, and fires up containers in your new workspace.
