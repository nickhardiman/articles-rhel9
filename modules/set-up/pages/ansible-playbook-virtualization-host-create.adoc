== write the virtualization-host playbook 

Create a playbook. 

[source,shell]
....
[nick@host1 ansible]$ vim virtualization-host.yml
....

This playbook doesn't do anything much. 
It's the role _virtualization-host_ that does the work. 
This role does not exist yet - we create that next. 


.ansible/virtualization-host.yml
[source,yaml]
....
---
- name: set up virtualization-host 
  hosts: localhost 
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes

  roles:
  - virtualization-host
....


That's the first file. 

[source,shell]
....
[nick@host1 ansible]$ tree
.
└── virtualization-host.yml

0 directories, 1 file
[nick@host1 ansible]$ 
....


== run the playbook
