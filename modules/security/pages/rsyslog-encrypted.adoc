== authentication

x.509

== TLS

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security[TLS (Transport Layer Security)] is the protocol defining how encryption works. 
The example below encrypts traffic and autheticates the server using an X.509 server certificate.
It does not authenticate syslog clients using client certificates - any client can connect to the rsyslog server. 

Two common sets of software used to make TLS work are GnuTLS and OpenSSL.

https://cromwell-intl.com/cybersecurity/rsyslog-tls/

As for cryptography, the OpenSSL project was founded in 1998. It provides a command-line tool and a library of cryptographic functions that applications can use.

Richard Stallman had a meltdown over how OpenSSL was open source but came with a license description he didn't prefer. So, the GnuTLS project was initially started around Marchâ€“November 2000.

== stream driver

Requires either the 
https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/concepts/ns_gtls.html[Gnu TLS]
stream driver or the 
https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/concepts/ns_ossl.html[OpenSSL] stream driver. 

== config

https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/tutorials/tls_cert_server.html#sample-syslog-conf

[source,shell]
----
module(load="imtcp" # TCP listener
    StreamDriver.Name="gtls"
    StreamDriver.Mode="1" # run driver in TLS-only mode
    StreamDriver.Authmode="anon"
    )

# make gtls driver the default and set certificate files
global(
    DefaultNetstreamDriver="gtls"
    DefaultNetstreamDriverCAFile="/path/to/contrib/gnutls/ca.pem"
    DefaultNetstreamDriverCertFile="/path/to/contrib/gnutls/cert.pem"
    DefaultNetstreamDriverKeyFile="/path/to/contrib/gnutls/key.pem"
    )

    # start up listener at port 6514
    input(
    type="imtcp"
    port="6514"
    )
