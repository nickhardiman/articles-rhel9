Use an SSH user certificate to log in.

This setup requires three hosts.

* secret.source.example.com is the CA host. This creates SSH certificates.
* git.source.example.com is the SSH client host. This trusts the CA's public key.
* test02.build.example.com is the SSH server host. This has an SSH host certificate.
