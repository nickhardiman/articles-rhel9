= add a RHEL 8 ISO to the images pool

We can use a *fresh install* process to build a new virtual machine and install the OS. 
But before we start, we need an install ISO. 
The ISO file acts like a DVD in an optical disk drive. 
For more information on Red Hat's ISO files, check out the https://access.redhat.com/solutions/104063[Understanding the various RHEL .iso files] page. 

Download the installer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9660[ISO] file and add it to libvirt's _images_ storage pool. 
Downloading the file requires access to Red Hat's customer portal and CDN. 
Use your developer account to log into the portal. 
The customer portal has documentation on https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/configuring_and_managing_virtualization/getting-started-with-virtualization-in-rhel-8_configuring-and-managing-virtualization#assembly_creating-virtual-machines_virt-getting-started[Creating virtual machines].



== download the RHEL 8 installer ISO

* Use a web browser. 
* Sign into the https://access.redhat.com/[customer portal]. 
* Find the [Download Red Hat Enterprise Linux] page. Downloads > Infrastructure Management > Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
* Change the version from the latest to 8.2.
* Have a look at what's on offer. The https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/479/ver=/rhel---8/8.2/x86_64/product-software[download page for RHEL 8] lists many installers (including a small ISO and a big DVD) and a ready-made KVM guest image. 
* Find the entry titled  _Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Binary DVD_.
* Download the DVD image from the customer portal to the images directory. More gory details on how to do this are below.

Downloading the ISO requires a little jumping around between the web browser interface and the command line interface. 
You could use the web browser to download, then copy from your workstation to _host1_. 
But this method get tricky with the URL and the _curl_ command.

Right-click the _Download Now_ button and copy the link address. 
It's a URL containing long strings of nonsense, along the lines of this one.  __https://access.cdn.redhat.com/content/origin/files/sha256/7f/1234/rhel-8.2-x86_64-dvd.iso?user=1234&_auth_=1234__.
Some of this nonsense is authorization tokens embedded in the URL. 

The download link is only valid for a few minutes, so this is a bad time for a coffee break. 
If using _curl_, like this example does, the link must be put in quotes so the ampersand *&* does not fool Bash into starting a background job. 

[source,shell]
----
[root@host1 ~]# cd /var/lib/libvirt/images/
[root@host1 images]# 
[root@host1 images]# curl --output rhel-8.2-x86_64-dvd.iso --location 'https://access.cdn.redhat.com/content/origin/files/sha256/7f/1234/rhel-8.2-x86_64-dvd.iso?user=1234&_auth_=1234'

This file is an 8GB monster. 
The download takes a while. 
This is a good time for a coffee break.  


== check the SELinux context 

If the file was downloaded somewhere else and moved, it may well have a different SELinux file context. 

This file was downloaded to a user's home dir first, then moved. 
It has a SELinux file type of __user_home_t__ (__admin_home_t__ belongs to root's home directory).

[source,shell]
....
[root@host1 images]# pwd
/var/lib/libvirt/images
[root@host1 images]# 
[root@host1 images]# ls -lZ
total 9244672
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 9466544128 Jan 11 14:21 rhel-8.3-x86_64-dvd.iso
[root@host1 images]# 
[root@host1 images]# cd
[root@host1 ~]#
....

Fix the file type. 

[source,shell]
....
[root@host1 ~]# restorecon -Rv /var/lib/libvirt/images/
Relabeled /var/lib/libvirt/images/rhel-8.3-x86_64-dvd.iso from unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 to unconfined_u:object_r:virt_image_t:s0
[root@host1 ~]# 
....



== refresh the libvirt pool 

Libvirt doesn't notice the new ISO file.

[source,shell]
....
[root@host1 ~]# virsh vol-list images
 Name   Path
--------------

[root@host1 ~]# 
....

Refresh the pool. 
This tells libvirt to take another look at what's stored in _images_. 

[source,shell]
....
[root@host1 ~]# 
[root@host1 ~]# virsh pool-refresh images
Pool images refreshed

[root@host1 ~]# 
....

The new file is now listed. 

[source,shell]
....
[root@host1 ~]# virsh vol-list images
 Name                      Path
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 rhel-8.3-x86_64-dvd.iso   /var/lib/libvirt/images/rhel-8.3-x86_64-dvd.iso

[root@host1 ~]# 
[root@host1 ~]# virsh vol-info rhel-8.3-x86_64-dvd.iso images
