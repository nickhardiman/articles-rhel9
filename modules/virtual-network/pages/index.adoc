!!! This page is a mess. 


Use libvirt to create a test network on my laptop.

This physical machine is the host to many virtual machines.

== virtual network 

Only one physical host, with many virtual guests. 

Good for 

* portability. Not the cross-platform programming kind, this is literally carrying your test network in a bag. 

Bad for 

* data center hardware tests - 10Gb ethernet, IPMI
* big VMs - Oracle database, Microsoft Windows
* other virtualization platforms - VMware, Openstack
* virtualization tricks - compressed storage, live migration 

Not sure about 

* multipath 
* VLAN
* RHV
* HA cluster
