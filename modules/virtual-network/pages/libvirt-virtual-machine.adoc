= create a virtual machine, then delete it

Create a VM, then destroy it. 
This new virtual machine exists inside the physical host machine. 
It can talk to the Internet via the host's ethernet interface. 

Use the golden image method of installation. 
Instead of installing packages and configuring the system using a kickstart file, copy the KVM file.

== create a storage volume 

[source,shell]
----
[root@host1 ~]# cd /var/lib/libvirt/images/
[root@host1 images]# ls
rhel-8.2-x86_64-kvm.qcow2   rhel-8.3-x86_64-dvd.iso
[root@host1 images]# 
[root@host1 images]# cp rhel-8.2-x86_64-kvm.qcow2 myfirstvm.qcow2
[root@host1 images]#

== create a virtual machine 

Create a VM using a ready-made disk image (guest-images/myfirstvm.qcow2). This is not the same as using an install ISO - the OS is already installed. 

A new VM can be created using a command like ``virsh define myfirstvm.xml``, 
similar to the way a storage pool can be created using ``virsh pool-define storage-pool.xml``.
But the XML configuration that defines a virtual machine is complicated. 
It's easier to use the ``virt-install`` command to do the hard work. 

This ``virt-install`` command creates a virtual machine.
The ``--os-variant`` option sets some values, including 2 CPUs and 1536 MB memory.

[source,shell]
----
virt-install \
  --name myfirstvm \
  --disk vol=images/myfirstvm.qcow2  \
  --os-variant rhel8.2 \
  --noautoconsole  \
  --import
----

This command creates a _guest domain_. In https://libvirt.org/goals.html[libvirt terminology], this command creates a domain on the node, which translates as a new guest machine running on the host machine.  

If you're wondering about the odd-looking MAC address ``52:54:00:00:00:01``, it's not one you'd find in public. 
The first part is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address#Universal_vs._local[locally administered address], so we can set the rest of the MAC address to anything we like. 
This address is set to serial number one, and padded with a lot of zeroes.
 

[source,shell]
----
[root@host1 ~]# virt-install   --name myfirstvm   --disk vol=images/myfirstvm.qcow2   --os-variant rhel8.2   --noautoconsole    --import
Using rhel8.2 default --memory 1536

Starting install...
Domain creation completed.
[root@host1 ~]#

== use the console 

Connect to the console with the command ``virsh console myfirstvm``.

It may take a few seconds for boot-up to finish. 
The login prompt may not appear until you hit the ``Enter`` key. 

The hostname is _localhost_. 
The ``--name`` option in the virt-install command doesn't change the hostname, or indeed anything in the KVM image. 

[source,shell]
----
[root@host1 ~]$ virsh console myfirstvm
Connected to domain myfirstvm
Escape character is ^]
(Enter)
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 (Ootpa)
Kernel 4.18.0-193.el8.x86_64 on an x86_64

Activate the web console with: systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket

localhost login: 
----

We can't log in, because no root password is set. 

Disconnect from the console with this key combination.

[source,shell]
----
myfirstvm login:  ^]
[root@host1 ~]$ 
----


== stop the VM

Stop the new VM with the command ``virsh shutdown myfirstvm``. 
This is a graceful shutdown, like running ``systemctl poweroff``.

If you want to pull the plug, use ``virsh destroy myfirstvm``.

[source,shell]
....
[root@host1 ~]$ virsh shutdown myfirstvm
Domain myfirstvm is being shutdown

[root@host1 ~]$ 
[root@host1 ~]$ virsh list --all
 Id    Name                           State
----------------------------------------------------
 -     myfirstvm                      shut off

[root@host1 ~]$ 
....


== restart the VM

Restart the new VM with the command ``virsh start myfirstvm``.

This ``virsh start`` command runs a huge ``qemu-kvm`` command with dozens of options. 
You can see it by running ``ps -fwwwC qemu-kvm``.

[source,shell]
....
[root@host1 ~]$ virsh start myfirstvm
Domain myfirstvm started

[root@host1 ~]$ 
[root@host1 ~]$ virsh list
 Id    Name                           State
----------------------------------------------------
 1     myfirstvm                      running

[root@host1 ~]$ 
....




== delete the VM

Delete the new VM with the command  ``virsh destroy myfirstvm``.

Power off the machine and remove its configuration. 

[source,shell]
....
[root@host1 ~]$ virsh destroy myfirstvm
Domain myfirstvm destroyed

[root@host1 ~]$ 
[root@host1 ~]# virsh undefine --remove-all-storage myfirstvm
Domain myfirstvm has been undefined
Volume 'vda'(/var/lib/libvirt/images/myfirstvm.qcow2) removed.

[root@host1 ~]# 
[root@host1 ~]$ virsh list --all
 Id    Name                           State
----------------------------------------------------

[root@host1 ~]$ 
....
