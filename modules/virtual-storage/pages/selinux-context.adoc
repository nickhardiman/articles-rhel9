If the file was downloaded somewhere else and moved, it may well have a different SELinux file context. 

== virt_image_t

We need the SELinux file type context label __virt_image_t__.

If a file is downloaded to a user's home directory first, then moved, 
the file has a SELinux file type of __user_home_t__ (or __admin_home_t__ from root's home directory).

[source,shell]
....
[root@host1 images]# pwd
/var/lib/libvirt/images
[root@host1 images]# 
[root@host1 images]# ls -lZ

== restorecon 

Fix the file type. 

[source,shell]
....
[root@host1 ~]# restorecon -Rv /var/lib/libvirt/images/
Relabeled /var/lib/libvirt/images/rhel-8.3-x86_64-dvd.iso from unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 to unconfined_u:object_r:virt_image_t:s0
