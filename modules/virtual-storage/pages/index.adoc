The https://libvirt.org/[libvirt] project provides a virtualization management system. 
It's used by RHV (Red Hat Virtualization), Openstack, and even the latest Openshift.

Libvirt [manages storage] using pools to store volumes.
Here the storage pool is a directory, _/var/lib/libvirt/images/_. 
It's a default location provided by libvirt. 
Other storage options include an NFS share, an iSCSI target or multipath to a SAN. 
The first things we put in here are installer ISO and disk image files.

The disk image used by a virtual machine is a storage volume. 
Install ISO files will also go in here. 

Create a libvirt storage pool using the ``virsh`` command.

== a storage pool for your image files  

Each virtual machine has a storage volume - this is the disk image.

A storage pool is where image files are kept. 
A storage pool can be made from many types of storage, 
like a local disk drive, a distributed file system, or a SCSI volume.
Machine image files contain a lot of empty space. 
Storing them somewhere that deduplicates blocks saves a lot of room. 
VDO 

We use the simplest kind of storage pool - a directory.
