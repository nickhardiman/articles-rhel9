Install the HAProxy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server[proxy server] on _guest1_. 
HAProxy is an intermediary between a web client and the web servers on _guest2_ and _guest4_.  
HAProxy is also a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)[load balancer], distributing requests evenly between _guest2_ and _guest4_.

HAProxy is a reverse proxy - it sends requests from many clients to a few servers.
The forward and reverse names come from an old networking idea that a device has a front and a back. 
Network kit, like an office, has a front end used by customers and a back end used by administrators. 
If the customers are in the office, the network kit is oriented so the front end faces them.
If customers are in the Internet, the network kit is reversed so the front faces them.
It's a https://www.txstate.edu/philosophy/resources/fallacy-definitions/Faulty-Analogy.html[faulty analogy] that has confused many people over many years. 

A proxy may talk a special proxy protocol, which requires clients are able to talk the same language. 
Or it may be transparent, where no client change is required. 
HAProxy is configured here to be transparent - it appears to be a regular web site.



== a load balancer 

The web servers on _guest2_ and _guest4_ are identical. 
It doesn't matter which one answers an HTTP request. 

HAProxy has a list of web servers and sends each new request to the next server on the list. 
This is a simple load-balancing algorithm called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)#Round-Robin[round-robin].

Other load balancing algorithms are _leastconn_, _source_ and _hdr_.
These are described in the file _/usr/share/doc/haproxy/intro.txt_.

In this example, curl is the web client and makes four requests. 
HAProxy even distributes these requests between the two nginx web servers.

== open the firewall

Tell firewalld to allow web server traffic.


[source,shell]
....
firewall-cmd --add-service http 
firewall-cmd --add-service http --permanent
firewall-cmd --add-service https 
firewall-cmd --add-service https --permanent
....

Let the network view the new stats page on port 9000.
The stats page is created next. 

[source,shell]
....
firewall-cmd --add-service https --permanent
firewall-cmd --add-port 9000/tcp
....


== add a stats page 

image::haproxy-stats.png[stats,width=587,height=900,title="HAProxy stats"]

The config file /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg is about 90 lines and load balances a cluster of applications running on the local machine _guest1_. 
There are no matching applications on the local machine, so haproxy isn't really doing anything useful.

[source,shell]
....
[root@guest1 ~]# cat  /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg 
#---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Example configuration for a possible web application.  See the
# full configuration options online.
#
#   https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/configuration.txt
...
    server  app2 127.0.0.1:5002 check
    server  app3 127.0.0.1:5003 check
    server  app4 127.0.0.1:5004 check
[root@guest1 ~]# 
....


=== configure 

Create a stats web page. 
Edit the config file. 

[source,shell]
....
[root@guest1 ~]# vi /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg 
....

Add these lines to the bottom of the config file.  

[source,shell]
....
listen stats
    bind :9000
    stats enable
    stats uri /
....

Restart HAProxy.

[source,shell]
....
[root@guest1 ~]# systemctl restart haproxy
[root@guest1 ~]# 
....

=== view the stats page  

Find the home network address of _guest1_.
In this example it's _192.168.1.217_. 

[source,shell]
....
ip addr show dev enp1s0
....

Open a web browser on the workstation.

Enter a URL in the form of http://192.168.1.217:9000/.

View the dashboard. 
The default app does not exist, so checks are failing.
Many lines are colored red. 



== load balance guest2 and guest4 

Allow HTTP traffic. 
Add these lines to the bottom of the config file. 

[source,shell]
....
frontend http-requests
    bind *:80
    default_backend http-requests
    option http

backend http-requests
    balance round-robin
    server guest2 192.168.152.100:80 check
    server guest4 192.168.152.101:80 check
....
