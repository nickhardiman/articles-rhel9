https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups[CGroups] are used for:

* *Resource limiting*  groups can be set to not exceed a configured memory limit, which also includes the file system cache[8][9]
* *Prioritization*     some groups may get a larger share of CPU utilization[10] or disk I/O throughput[11]
* *Accounting*         measures a group's resource usage, which may be used, for example, for billing purposes[12]
* *Control*            freezing groups of processes, their checkpointing and restarting[12]

Demonstrate resource limiting by being really horrible to Apache using cgroups. 

Drag down Apache's performance by throttling CPU.

Kill Apache's children by limiting memory.

Slow Apache down by throttling disk read.
