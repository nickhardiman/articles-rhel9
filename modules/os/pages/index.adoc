When a user turns on a computer - a physical computer - there is plenty of hardware and software action in the few seconds before Linux starts. The software that controls these early stages is called firmware.

A boot loader is a collection of programs to get a system ready. Boot loaders are split into two groups.

* The first stage boot loader gets hardware ready.
* The second stage boot loader launches the OS.


== OS

The operating system is another collection of programs, split into three groups. 

* The kernel manages the machine, and supervises scheduling of user programs. 
* A shell handles communication between user and system. 
* Many utility programs help with tasks. All the commands in /usr/bin/ are utility programs.
