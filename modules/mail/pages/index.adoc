Use postfix to send and receive e-mail. 
The proper name for an e-mail sending and receiving system in SMTP land is MTA (Mail Transport Agent).
E-mail, along with logs and metrics, is a way for the system to communicate with the sysadmin and automate tasks. 
For instance, git can send code patches by e-mail.

Postfix on guest1 will receive mail from all the VMs. 

This postfix service won't communicate with the outside world. 
Setting up a public e-mail service is risky and complicated. 
Automated programs search the Internet for badly configured mail servers, so spammers can send a ton of junk to innocent in-boxes.
