Sometimes, I get the chance to write up my work. 
These https://antora.org/[Antora] and 
https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] files are the source of 
https://hardiman.consulting/rhel/9/index.html. 

If you have Antora, build a local copy of the web site for yourself. 
Instructions on how to build the web site are posted at 
https://github.com/nickhardiman/docs-site.

[NOTE]
====
These docs have nothing to do with any https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9-beta[official RHEL 9 docs].
